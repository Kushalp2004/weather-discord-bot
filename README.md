## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Run

### Bot Intents (Important!)

Before running the bot, you **must** enable the following **Privileged Gateway Intents** under the **"Bot"** section in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications):

* **PRESENCE INTENT**
* **SERVER MEMBERS INTENT**
* **MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT**

These are necessary for the bot to read messages and function correctly.

### Setup `config.py`

In the root of your cloned project, you'll find a `config.py` file. Open it and replace the placeholder values with your actual tokens:

```python
# config.py
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN = "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
WEATHER_API_KEY = "YOUR_WEATHER_API_KEY_HERE"
```

### Running the Bot

Once `config.py` is updated and the required Python libraries are installed, you're ready to launch the bot!

1.  Ensure the bot is present in your desired Discord server.
2.  From your terminal, inside the `weather-api-discord-bot` directory, run the main bot file:

    ```bash
    python weather.py
    ```

    The bot should come online and appear active in your Discord server!
